# RFSuite Lua Scripts for Ethos

**Inav** is a powerful flight control software suite built specifically for **single-rotor RC helicopters**. It is not designed for multirotors or airplanes. The software includes:

-   **Inav Flight Controller Firmware**
    
-   **Inav Configurator** – used for flashing and configuring the flight controller
    
-   **Inav Blackbox Explorer** – for analyzing flight logs
    
-   **Inav Lua Scripts** – used to configure the flight controller directly from your transmitter
    

These scripts support the following transmitter operating systems:

-   **EdgeTX / OpenTX**
    
-   **Ethos** (this repository)
    

Inav is based on **Betaflight 4.3**, but includes a wide range of advanced features optimized for helicopter flight. This version of Inav is also referred to as **Inav 2 (RF2)**.

----------

## What is RFSuite?

**RFSuite** is a touch-based, Lua-scripted GUI suite for the Ethos platform. It enables easy setup, tuning, and diagnostics of Inav-based helicopters using supported FrSky transmitters. It offers:

-   Full touchscreen interface
    
-   FrSky and ELRS receiver compatibility
    
-   Multiple embedded tools and widgets
    

You can preview the experience using the interactive simulator:

👉 [**Launch Web Simulator**](https://ethos.studio1247.com/nightly16/X20PRO_FCC?backup=https://github.com/rotorflight/inav-lua-ethos-suite/raw/refs/heads/master/demo/DEMO.zip&reset=all&language=en)

This opens the RFSuite in your browser, showcasing its functionality within the Ethos UI.

## Development Guide

To build and deploy RFSuite locally:

### Requirements

-   FrSky Simulator (Ethos)
    
-   Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
    
-   Python 3
    
-   Install tqdm and serial:
    
    ```bash
    pip install tqdm
    pip install serial
    ```

If you do not have npm command, you will need to install NodeJS   

### Config file

Copy the file bin/config-example.json to a folder outside of github and name to suite your preference.

Setup en env var of INAVSUITE_CONFIG=C:\GitHub\inav-lua-ethos-suite.json  (the path to the file)

Suggested:
Repo:  C:\GitHub\inav-lua-ethos-suite\<files>
Config: C:\GitHub\inav-lua-ethos-suite.json


### VS Code Tasks

-   **Deploy & Launch** – Pushes scripts to the default simulator

-   **Deploy & Choose** – Pushes scripts to the selected simulator 
    
-   **Deploy Radio** – Pushes scripts to the radio

-   **Deploy Radio and  Debug** – Pushes scripts to the radio and starts serial console
